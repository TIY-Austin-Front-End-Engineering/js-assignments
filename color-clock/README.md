# color-clock

## Objectives

This assignment serves to reinforce JS fundamentals with `setInterval`, writing to the DOM, practicing CSS animations, positions, and transforms, and finally breaking down complex problems into simple sequences in code.

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of functions, loops/array, variadic behavior
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS
* Demonstrate Functional Programming methods
* Convert numbers between binary and hex (using `parseInt()` and `Number.toString()`)
* Demonstrate understanding of DOM APIs for querying, reading from, and writing to DOM elements

## Details

### Instructions

```sh
# cd into your Github projects folder 
# mkdir <projectname>
# cd into that project
# then ...

$ git init

$ hub create <projectName>

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-Houston-Front-End-Engineering/Notes-Backbone-React-ES6/master/extras/package.json > package.json

$ npm install

```

### Requirements

* Write some assertions for your JS code that converts decimal to hex, and vice-versa.
* A visible, up-to-date `gh-pages` branch must be on Github. If you are pushing to Divshot / Heroku / AWS / etc, that is also fine... as long as we can load the page on the web!

## Normal Mode
