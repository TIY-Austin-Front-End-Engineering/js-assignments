## Details

### Instructions

```sh
$ cd <Projects folder>
$ mkdir <projectname>

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-Houston-Front-End-Engineering/Notes-Backbone-React-ES6/master/extras/package.json > package.json
$ npm install
```

### Requirements

* A visible, up-to-date `gh-pages` branch must be on Github. If you are pushing to Divshot / Heroku / AWS / etc, that is also fine... as long as we can load the page on the web!
