## Description
[Medium](http://medium.com), a popular blogging platform, incorporates a cool little feature to every post that tells you approximately how long it will take you to read an article/post.

For this assignment, you will be creating this feature by fixing the failing tests in `spec/read.spec.js` by updating the `readTime.js` file.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Breaking down a software feature into smaller parts
* Use String, Array, and Object methods such as `.split(), .join(), .length`.
* Understand the basic Document Object Model (DOM) and how we can access and manipulate elements in an HTML document.
* Beginning familiarity with getting elements in the DOM with javascript, such as:
  - `document.querySelector('#idName')`
  - `document.querySelectorAll('.className')`
  - `document.getElementById('nameOfId')`
  - `document.getElementByClassName('nameOfClass')`
  - `document.getElementByTagName('nameOfTag')`
* Ability to follow a specification of tests to build software.
* Understand the benefits of test driven development.
* Basic understanding of the use of industry leading unit test frameworks (Mocha & Chai).

## Details

### Deliverables

Update `readTime.js` to solve all the test in `spec/readTime.spec.js`

Open `spec/testRunner.html` in the browser to see the seven failing tests.  MAKE THEM PASS!

### Directions

- Copy this assignment, including the associated files.
- View failing tests in `spec/readTime.spec.js`
- Update the `readTime.js` file so that all tests pass in `spec/testRunner.html`
- Please note you'll need to `bower install` so that you get the required libraries (Mocha & Chai)
