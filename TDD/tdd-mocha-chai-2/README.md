# tdd-mocha-chai-2

## Description
In the files `foo.js` and `bar.js` you will find 2 constructors called foo and bar respectively. Foo is empty and Bar is already implemented.

### Part 1
There is a spec (test) already included for foo in the file `test.foo.js` but it is currently in the red. You need to implement the behavior on Foo to make it pass the tests.

### Part 2
Bar is already implemented but has no tests. Write a test for every method on Bar. Save this in `test.bar.js`.
