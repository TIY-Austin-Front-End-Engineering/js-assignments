# js-functions-datatypes-math-1

## Description

This assignment serves to reinforce JS syntax, functions, and some mathematical operators and sequences.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand general JS syntax
* Grasp why functions are important
* Understand arrays and loops
* Be able to recite the meaning and importance of SOLID principles
* By able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* The terminal and `node` to test your JS

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing atleast:
  * `main.js`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors
* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output

## Easy Mode

Create a new Github repo and add [./exercises-1.js] to it. Make your edits to the functions in the "exercises-1" file.

Instead of using the browser and the Chrome Dev Tools console to look at your JS output, use `node exercises-1.js` to print the output to your terminal.

## Hard Mode

In addition to the [easy mode](#easy-mode), write a function in "exercises-1" that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
