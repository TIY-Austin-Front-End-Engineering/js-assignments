# Refactoring

## Description
There is an included file called `refactor.js`, it contains 10 pieces of code that need to be refactored. There is a description above each snippet of code explaining how it should be refactored. There is also a place for you to put your answer. Copy the file to your own repo and complete each question. I want __at least one commit for each question__. You may make multiple commits for each question but you may not make a single commit for more than one question. __Do not edit any part of the document other than to add your code to the specified area__. Any answers that require explanation need to be done so via comments so that this remains a __valid javascript file__ when you turn yours in.
