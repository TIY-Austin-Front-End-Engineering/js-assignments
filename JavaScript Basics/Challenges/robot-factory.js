// Define a function called `Robot()`.
// Typically, we would create a new instance with `new Robot()`.
// Instead, create a "factory" that creates more `Robot`s with this call:
// ---
// Robot.new()
//
// When `Robot.new()` is called it should return a new instance with the prototype set to Robot e.g.:
// ---
// var robby = Robot.new();
