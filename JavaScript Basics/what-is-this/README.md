## Normal Mode
You are a scientist who has just discovered a *mysterious* new element in your lab. Since creativity isn't your strong suit, you name the element `this`. Your job is to figure out the properties of this new element as well as how it interacts with its environment.

Each of the examples in [whatIsThis.js](whatIsThis.js) will run the `whatIsThis` function that is defined on line 4. Run through each example in whatIsThis.js, one by one (commenting out the previous example and uncomment the current example as necessary). In the comments section below each example fill in what `this` is referencing inside of the whatIsThis function. Why? If it throws an error, why is it throwing an error?

You can open index.html in your browser and view your console to get started.
