# Albums and Artists

## Description

Create a program to store, change, and communicate information about albums and their artists.

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Understand JS syntax
* Demonstrate understanding of JS basics(loops, arrays, map/reduce/filter, etc), JS scope, storing data in a persistent mechanism (Nightmare Mode), Backbone, state management, and updating the DOM with JS

## Instructions (Easy Mode)

You are a manager who runs a music store.  Unfortunately, cassette tapes are being sold SO QUICKLY that you can't keep track of your inventory, nor can you remember what's on sale at any given time.

Build a structure to keep track of your albums (with their names, number in stock, normal price, and sale price), artists (with their names), and which artist created which albums.  You should be able to:

* Create a new album (once you know its name, number in stock, and normal price).
* Sell a copy of an album.
* Increase the number of copies of an album you have in stock.
* Get a count of how many copies of a particular album you have in stock.
* Get the current price of an album.

## Instructions (Nightmare Mode)

In addition to Easy Mode, you should be able to:

* Create a new artist (once you know his/her name).
* Assign an album to an artist's catalog.
* Put a discount percentage on an album.
* Put a discount percentage on an artist's entire catalog.
* Have the data persist in a method of persistent storage (localstorage, Parse, Firebase, Mongo, Sails.js, etc)
