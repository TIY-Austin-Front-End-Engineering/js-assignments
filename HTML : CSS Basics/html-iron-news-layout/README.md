## HTML/CSS/Git Intro - Iron News

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... *minimalist* design ethic.

Since it's so simple (there's only one image!) we're going to start off here.

At the same time, we're also going to get into the habit of frequently creating git commits as checkpoints.
