  * `main.js`
  * `index.html`

* A link to the deployed project

### Requirements

* No JavaScript warnings or errors


## Normal Mode

1. Use the HTML provided in `index.html` and set up a new project
2. Create a `main.js` file and link it to your `index.html` file
3. Using the DOM API and the elements on the page, set up the following:
