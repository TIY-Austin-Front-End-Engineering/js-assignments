  * `dist/index.html`
* There must be at least one commit for each stage (see below) of the webpage.
* All of your files should be inside a `dist` directory. When you look at your repo on github, all of the necessary files should be in a directory called `dist`.

### Requirements

* No W3C Validation Warnings
* The page should not be a fixed width, but instead scale as the browser window expands or shrinks. Margins and spacing should not be effected by resizing the window.
* You must use [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for cross browser consistency.


## Normal Mode
Over the course of this assignment you will develop the mobile version of the [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) website. The project is broken into four stages. The stages will take you through laying out the scaffolding for the page, filling in styles, text and finally images. You must follow each stage, don't skip!
