## HTML and CSS Introduction

### Description

Everyone has to ship code on day 1 :)

### Objectives

##### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand the building blocks of web development
* Be comfortable with the general requirements for submitting assignments :)

##### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* HTML (and W3C validation)
* CSS
* Codepen
* Github issues

### Details

#### Deliverables

* Links to your Codepen(s)

### Normal Mode

Create a Codepen that contains at least **10** distinct HTML tags, and **10** different CSS properties.

Your HTML should be valid, semantic, and go at least four levels deep.

Your CSS should be valid and use at least three complex selectors.

### Hard Mode

In addition to normal mode, take a look at [this Codepen](http://codepen.io/kylf/pen/OPmvew?editors=110). It's a reproduction of an actual problem that I helped a friend with recently -- the HTML in his page wasn't valid, and as a result there were a few rendering bugs.

* text starts getting bold for no reason
* some content is shifted over to the left

Make a fork of the Codepen (just hit the "Fork" button on the top) and fix the HTML bugs.
