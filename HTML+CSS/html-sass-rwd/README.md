# Sk8 Site - Wireframe => HTML

## Description
Without fail, a front-end developer will need to convert a wireframe into a fully functioning website, and responsive at that.

For this assignment, you'll be creating this below wireframe and turning into a site that not only renders well from a normal desktop size, but also transitions and is very usable on smaller viewports.
