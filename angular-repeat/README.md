  * `scripts/controllers.js`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors


## Normal Mode
Clone this repository and follow the instructions within the comments inside of the `index.html` file. Included in this repository is a half finished angular project with two controllers. Use the ng-repeat directive to display the data that has been defined in the controllers *without modifying the structure of the data.*
